TASK 2 ðŸš€
// look at the code below and explain in your own words where the variable 'count' is available. 
// Explain why 'count' is initialized with a let and not a var or const. 
// Explain how initalizing the variable 'count' with a var would change it's scope

TASK 3 ðŸš€
* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. If it dosent fall in with any oter rule then "this" will default to window unless using strict mode
* 2. When the fucntion is invoked, look to the left of the dot that is what "this" refers to only to object w/ methods
* 3. using the 'new keyword contructs a new object and 'this points to it
* 4. when using call or apply method "this" is clearly defined
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.
  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.  
  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.
  
  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
